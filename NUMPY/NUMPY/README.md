## Notebooks

1. **01_array_creation_and_indexing.ipynb**: 
   - Learn about creating and indexing NumPy arrays.
   - Includes exercises and examples for different array creation methods.

2. **02_broadcasting_concepts.ipynb**: 
   - Study the concept of broadcasting in NumPy.
   - Provides visual examples and exercises to understand how broadcasting works with different array shapes.

3. **03_vectorization_operations.ipynb**: 
   - Practice vectorization operations in NumPy.
   - Contains examples of how to perform operations on arrays without using explicit loops.

4. **04_numpy_array_calculator_project.ipynb**: 
   - Build a NumPy Array Calculator.
   - Guides users through implementing basic calculator functionalities using NumPy arrays.

## Source Files

- **src/array_creation.py**: Functions for creating NumPy arrays using various methods such as `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, and `np.arange`. Includes examples of indexing and slicing.

- **src/broadcasting.py**: Functions that demonstrate broadcasting in NumPy, with examples of operations on arrays of different shapes and explanations of the broadcasting rules.

- **src/vectorization.py**: Functions illustrating vectorization operations in NumPy, including examples of applying mathematical functions to entire arrays efficiently.

- **src/numpy_array_calculator.py**: Implements the NumPy Array Calculator project with functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on NumPy arrays and a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to follow along with the exercises and examples. The source files in the `src` directory can be run independently to explore the functionalities of NumPy.

Happy learning!
